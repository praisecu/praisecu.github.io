Welcome to Perception, Robotics, AI and Sensing (PRAISe) Lab, led by Prof. Chahat Deep Singh.
We work at the intersection of Perception, Robotics, AI, and Computational Imaging to push the boundaries of robot autonomy. Our minimal perception framework holds the key to developing small yet intelligent and efficient robot navigation systems. We focus on active and bio-inspired perception algorithms, validating our theories by developing and deploying them on robots.
